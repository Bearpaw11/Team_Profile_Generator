# Team_Profile_Generator

This is a CLI program that gathers team info and generates an HTML page displaying team info

This program passes all the unit tests that are in the test file. You can check these tests by running "npm run test" on the the command line in this directory.

This code is written to be modular in that the the employee constructor and prototypes are in separate files and serve their individual purpose.

Jest and Inquirer were the NPM modules used.

To use go to the terminal under this directory and type "node app.js" and answer all questions about your team. Then see the file named team.html that is generated from your inputs in the folder.

On the html file the github user name and email are links and can be clicked.
